# 2024 Big Data Idea Challenge - Football & Regional Economy

This project was submitted to the **2024 Big Data Analysis Idea Challenge**  hosted by the **Big Data Innovation Convergence Program, Sookmyung Women’s University**.
We analyzed how professional football games influence regional commercial areas, using big data such as match attendance, local sales, and seasonal variations.  
The project proposes a data-driven **business strategy to boost local economy** via football tourism and stadium-linked commerce.
